# Scraping with Scrapy

In this project, you will use Scrapy to scrape content from websites.  Because the scrapy engine is run from the command line, you will develop a spider class and save it to a file, then run the engine using that file.  

Start with the Notebook `Project.ipynb`, and best of luck!
